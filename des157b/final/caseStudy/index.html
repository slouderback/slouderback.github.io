            This project will explore how different generations use media today
            and how they choose to create new media themselves. The project will
            be designed for both web and mobile thus requiring it to be
            responsive to all sizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will use chart.js to create the charts/plots such as bar graphs,
            pie charts, and doughnut charts. For color I plan on allowing
            different color schemes as a user choice however the format will be
            a two color scheme. One color will be a primary and the other will
            be the accent.

          <p>
            I looked at a lot of other websites that had a sort of inforgraphic
            style to them for inspiration and understanding of best practices
            for this type of site.
          </p>

          <p>
            I noticed there was a lot of focus on glance value such that a user
            could take a quick glance at your graphs and get an idea of whats
            going on. Also consistent color usage was really key for this and
            for understanding of the data when you start to examine it over
            time.

          <div class="gridEqualColumn">
            <p>
              I wanted to create a layout similar to stripes page. I have always
              really liked their design style and I think how they allow images
              to appear above everything else is an amazing technique.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that in mind I made the form on the landing page try to look
              as if it was above everything else. However I wanted to graphs to
              be the center of the rest of the site so I went for a very
              minimalist style throughout the whole site but even more post page
              one. The color choice for the graphs was something I spent a long
              time testing and trying to find the right ones. The thing I wanted
              was for the color to really represent the medium it was attached
              to while still being a set of colors that looked good together.

              Naviagation was left extermely simple because I have never found
              sites with complex naviagation to be something I found as a
              benifit. The one expection to this for me is if your site is a
              store then having a "catalogue" drop down menu flow makes sense.
            </p>

            <p>
              However since this site isnt that I left the naviagation to be
              just scrolling down and clicking through pages on a form. There is
              more subtle navigation within the charts themselves when you hover
              certain over certain parts but none of that is central to the site
              so im ok with leaving it in.

    <!--/ /-------- Usability Test Section --------/ /-->
    <section id="usability">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Usability Testing &amp; Further Development</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Usability was mostly focused in the form because form progression
            can be a huge driver of users leaving your site. Even though the
            form isnt required I was worried if someone started it then gave up
            halfway through the logical things to do would be close the site.
            For this reason I made the form a two page flow and included the
            tracker at the top.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other major thing I noticed from usability was that while there
            was a lot of work that had to be done to generate the graphs they
            dont take more than a few seconds to fully understand for the user.
            Because of this I went back and added in that second page of the
            form to be able to generate more later content and also allow some
            direct way for users to leave their response at a length that suits
            them. One of the most interesting questions in the form is the final
            question that allows users to write down anything that comes to mind
            thus leading to a style of answers I no longer control. Eventually I
            want to build a function that auto generates a word cloud from that
            data.

          <p>
            From this project I learned how data can have a lot going into it
            yet produce such a small piece of content for your site. It made me
            appreciate those inforgraphics that go viral on social media so much
            more because I now have context for understanding how much data they
            needed to use and condense.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this project im most proud of the charts being automatically
            updated as the form gets more and more responses. I dont need to do
            anything for the data to get updated and shown in the graphs so in
            theory this could continute to "update" even without my action.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most challenging thing for this was finding a way to make this
            kind of site look interesting. I dont think I really got it right
            but I definitely improved the quality of it through development.
