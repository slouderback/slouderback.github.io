          This page is a collection of thoughts of the author around why people
          choose to create. Their claims are that people create for a variety of
          reason from emotions, desire for calm, and even money. I chose this
          source because it gives me a good bouncing off point for my data
          collection methods of what to expect and once I have data I can
          compare my findings to their claims.

          This article is a data presentation of statistics about media
          consumption in America regardfing things like platform, age, and paid
          vs unpaid consumption. This is useful for me because it not only
          introduced new aspects of media consumption I hadnt thought of but
          also provides new data to compare mine to at the end of this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's New in Publishing is more of a summary source for newly
          published data. In this page they are going over the "US Media
          Consumption Report 2021" conducted by Attest. I went for this source
          over the original report because this is much more digestable and
          hihglights key points. However its important to also maintain a link
          to the original data for future use.

          This source covers art trends occuring today. It goes over popular art
          styles and discusses their role in todays art climate, technologies
          role in art and how it can be used as a medium, and concludes with how
          old school art mediums are still popular today. This source fills a
          gap for me regarding classical "art". The previous source talks about
          media/news usage and this one covers art usage.

          The author of this is Bryan Mullennix, a commercial photographer who
          has semi retired and gone back to "enjoy art for arts sake". He has
          spent his whole career in this field watching it evolve and thus can
          provide useful insight into trends over recent years.
