        In this project I want to include features such that the user is able to
        click and scroll to naviagate a webpage of charts and analysis. Some of
        these features are the graphs themselves, color switching, and data
        collection/storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do this I will need to use Chart.js, Back4App, and likely
        fullpage.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of right now I have experience with all of them so I believe I will
        be able to do this. I am however considering moving off of Back4App and
        using MongoDB and node.js to handle the backend needs. However that will
        only be if I find Back4App can not do what I need it to do or I have
        extra time.
