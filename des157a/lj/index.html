          <h2>Game Design UX for mobile</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Mobile gaming is a quickly expanding use case for mobile devices
              and as most of us know it's easy to get wrong. Here's a breakdown
              of some of the most important methods to make sure you make a good
              game. First, when you consider that most of your users are right
              handed you can realize that the easiest place for the user to tap
              on is the bottom left area. Therefore if you can you should put
              interactable things like buttons there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hardest spot to reach will always be the top so while you can
              still put things up there make sure they aren't important. For
              instance put the store button in the easy spot and put something
              like the settings menu up on top of the screen. While settings are
              important it is likely the user will only need to go there once or
              twice so it isn't a high-use screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big thing from this is always put the "correct"
              button/choice on the right side of the screen in the
              easier-to-reach spot. This begs the question: What is the correct
              button or choice? The answer is that it is whatever you want the
              user to do. An example is on the quit confirmation screen have the
              button that keeps your app open on the right and the final close
              button on the left.

          <div class="articleContent">

            <div class="imageText">
              <p>
                This is an image of the actual set of The Shire in New Zealand
                that they used to film The Hobbit. You can see a lot going on
                here from the varying colored doors, the light hitting the grass
                with the shadows, to the shimmering on the water.
              </p>
              <p>
                This picture is important to me because it came out so well for
                one of my first pictures. It is also a memory of a trip I took
                with my dad to a spot that is the real-life version of one of my
                favorite movie series.
              </p>
              <p>
                This image is one part of a larger collection I put together
                that tells a story of not only my progress as a photographer but
                also gives a glimpse into what I find important in life. I
                believe that we take photos of the things we find important and
                therefore any collection of photos from someone shows a little
                bit of who they are.

                <p>
                  This image is showing a New York Times bestseller called Beach
                  Read underneath a bowl of mixed berries, chocolate chips, and
                  nuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think the most interesting part of this image is the bowl of
                  food because these foods clearly dont belong together. Which
                  to me says they were chosen carefully to try to convey some
                  message.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Most obviously this image shows a book and a fruit bowl but when
                you take a minutes and really look at it you realize none of it
                makes sense. Why is there a bowl of food that doesnt go together
                attached to a book called Beach Read? Maybe its trying to show
                how there are so many different ways to enjoy yourself at the
                beach. Some people may want fresh fruit, some may want mixed
                nuts, and some may want chocolate.

          <h2>How to use pictures to tell a story</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Images and user interaction can make or break a site yet they can
              be done in nearly infinite ways. For instance, look at
              <a href="https://areyou.okok.services/meter/001/">Are you Ok?</a>
              where they use an interactive device to measure emotional
              intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site is of course somewhat of a joke site but the UX is
              really solid. Just through the visuals, users know they can move
              the object around and it uses our built-in understanding of dials,
              buttons, and wheels to show us we can click on these things.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this site, we can see that you don't need fancy tricks to
              show usability. We can use the basic knowledge of the user to show
              not tell usability and sometimes it is ok to create things that
              the user has to explore to understand. However, what they do well
              is in case you are confused they do have instructions available
              for you so there is a backup.

          <h2>Modals and Overlays and Dialog Windows Oh My!</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Modal, Overlays, and Dialog windows solve a very important UI
              problem and are loved by designers. However, they are a bit too
              loved because now users are often conditioned to just instantly
              close them even though they might be important. So this begs the
              question of how can we use them in such a way that they inherently
              convey importance such that the user will not instantly close
              them?
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important thing will be to create an effective modal. To
              do this the modal will need to be short and have the features
              users expect. To summarize the biggest ones are having an escape
              hatch so the user can leave the modal if they want to, a good
              title, buttons with actionable understandable names, and ideally
              centered on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, there are many others however the applicable ones
              really depend on the purpose of the modal. The last important
              thing to mention is that there are some giveaways that you
              shouldn't be using a modal. For instance, if you find you need to
              scroll in your modal maybe you should just separate out this
              content onto a second page instead.

          <h2>Forms - Best Practice</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Long and complicated forms are one of the top reasons users will
              abandon your page so you need to make sure you get them right. To
              do this web developers and designers have found a few tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
              A full list of these tricks could go on for pages and pages but as
              long as you nail the most important ones your form will be filled.
              The first one is using the sunk cost fallacy to your advantage.
              Once the user starts the form they feel like they have invested
              into it and at that point wont throw away their work/time so
              easily. So start with the easy questions like name, email, etc. If
              you lead with credit card info or something similar then the
              effort of going and getting their card is likely to make them
              abandon the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big one is to label all of your inputs and if you use
              placeholder text dont let it disappear once the user starts
              filling in the field. If they get confused or forget what that
              information was they will have to delete what they have already
              inputted to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final one, for now, is to always show any input or formatting
              requirements constantly. If a user has to start guessing what the
              required format is for a given field (like a password field) they
              will quickly become frustrated and reevaluate if they really need
              this form to be completed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Case Study - Spotify</h3>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Spotify's sign up form is really well designed in the sense that
              they follow a lot of the best practices but they also break their
              own style to simplify the form. If you go to
              <a href="http://www.spotify.com">spotify</a> then you will see
              that their site has huge text positioned all over the place, crazy
              colors, and shapes positioned along the site. Yet if you go to
              <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup">sign up</a> the only
              thing on the page is their logo and sign up fields/options.
            </p>
            <p>
              They reduce all of the unnecessary noise to allow the focus of the
              user to only ever be on the form which increases clarity and makes
              the form seem a lot simpler than it otherwise would have seemed.
              Also as a Spotify user they need a lot more information from you
              than is on this form however this is the bare amount of
              information they need to get you to use their product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you start using the product you will (hopefully) love it and
              be much more willing to input information into a product you know
              and love than some new website that hasnt provided anything to you
              yet.
