          <h2>Modals and Overlays and Dialog Windows Oh My!</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Modal, Overlays, and Dialog windows solve a very important UI
              problem and are loved by designers. However, they are a bit too
              loved because now users are often conditioned to just instantly
              close them even thought they might be important. So this begs the
              question of how can we use them in such a way that they
              inheriently convey importance such that the user will not
              instantly close them?
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important thing will be to create an effective modal. To
              do this the modal will need to be short and have the features
              users expect. To summarize the biggest ones are having an escape
              hatch so the user can leave the modal if they want to, a good
              title, buttons with actionable understandable names, and ideally
              cenetered on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, there are many others however the applicable ones
              really depend on the purpose of the modal. The last important
              thing to mention is that there are some giveaways that you
              shouldnt be using a modal. For instance if you find you need to
              scroll in your modal maybe you should just seperate out this
              content onto a second page instead.

          <h2>Forms - Best Practice</h2>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Long and complicated forms are one of the top reasons users will
              abandon your page so you need to make sure you get them right. To
              do this web developers and designers have found a few tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
              A full list of these tricks could go on for pages and pages but as
              long as you nail the most important ones your form will be filled.
              The first one is using the sunk cost fallacy to your advantage.
              Once the user starts the form they feel like they have invested
              into it and at that point wont throw away their work/time so
              easily. So start with the easy questions like name, email, etc. If
              you lead with credit card info or something similar then the
              effort of going and getting their card is likely to make them
              abandon the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big one is to label all of your inputs and if you use
              placeholder text dont let it disappear once the user starts
              filling in the field. If they get confused or forget what that
              information was they will have to delete what they have already
              inputted to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final one, for now, is to always show any input or formatting
              requirements constantly. If a user has to start guessing what the
              required format is for a given field (like a password field) they
              will quickly become frustrated and reevaluate if they really need
              this form to be completed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Case Study - Spotify</h3>
          <div class="articleContent">
            <p>
              Spotify's sign up form is really well designed in the sense that
              they follow a lot of the best practices but they also break their
              own style to simplify the form. If you go to
              <a href="http://www.spotify.com">spotify</a> then you will see
              that their site has huge text positioned all over the place, crazy
              colors, and shapes positioned along the site. Yet if you go to
              <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup">sign up</a> the only
              thing on the page is their logo and sign up fields/options.
            </p>
            <p>
              They reduce all of the unnecessary noise to allow the focus of the
              user to only ever be on the form which increases clarity and makes
              the form seem a lot simpler than it otherwise would have seemed.
              Also as a Spotify user they need a lot more information from you
              than is on this form however this is the bare amount of
              information they need to get you to use their product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you start using the product you will (hopefully) love it and
              be much more willing to input information into a product you know
              and love than some new website that hasnt provided anything to you
              yet.
