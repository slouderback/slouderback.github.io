          <h2>Forms - Best Practice</h2>
          <p>
            Long and complicated forms are one of the top reasons users will
            abandon your page so you need to make sure you get them right. To do
            this web developers and designers have found a few tricks.
          </p>
          <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
          <p>
            A full list of these tricks could go on for pages and pages but as
            long as you nail the most important ones your form will be filled.
            The first one is using the sunk cost fallacy to your advantage. Once
            the user starts the form they feel like they have invested into it
            and at that point wont throw away their work/time so easily. So
            start with the easy questions like name, email, etc. If you lead
            with credit card info or something similar then the effort of going
            and getting their card is likely to make them abandon the form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another big one is to label all of your inputs and if you use
            placeholder text dont let it disappear once the user starts filling
            in the field. If they get confused or forget what that information
            was they will have to delete what they have already inputted to see
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final one, for now, is to always show any input or formatting
            requirements constantly. If a user has to start guessing what the
            required format is for a given field (like a password field) they
            will quickly become frustrated and reevaluate if they really need
            this form to be completed.

          <h2>Case Study - Spotify</h2>
          <p>
            Spotify's sign up form is really well designed in the sense that
            they follow a lot of the best practices but they also break their
            own style to simplify the form. If you go to
            <a href="http://www.spotify.com">spotify</a> then you will see that
            their site has huge text positioned all over the place, crazy
            colors, and shapes positioned along the site. Yet if you go to
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup">sign up</a> the only
            thing on the page is their logo and sign up fields/options.
          </p>
          <p>
            They reduce all of the unnecessary noise to allow the focus of the
            user to only ever be on the form which increases clarity and makes
            the form seem a lot simpler than it otherwise would have seemed.
            Also as a Spotify user they need a lot more information from you
            than is on this form however this is the bare amount of information
            they need to get you to use their product. Once you start using the
            product you will (hopefully) love it and be much more willing to
            input information into a product you know and love than some new
            website that hasnt provided anything to you yet.
