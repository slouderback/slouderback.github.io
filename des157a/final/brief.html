            I chose this site because it does a good job with having images
            flying in from all parts of the screen which is something I want to
            do but in reverse. I struggled with making images that fly off of
            your screen look natural and have variance yet they make it look
            effortless. Some of the techniques they used are having images fade
            out as well or disappear from the top-down/sides.

            They have a really well-done integration of images into their site.
            They applied a background/border on their images to make them seem
            like postcards, while also applying a tilt to them to further make
            them seem like natural pictures. One of the problems with my site is
            that the images appear to not really fit into the page and seemed
            harsh.

          My goals for this project are to make the images fit into the page
          more, have more variety and fluidity to the images flying off the
          screen, and improve text display in terms of font and sizing.
        </p>

          I'm sort of locked into this color scheme because the rest of my site
          follows it so I don't want to change the colors. I want to use a more
          simple looking font so likely not a serif font.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the interactions, I'm leaning towards moving away from clicking to
          be the way to progress and replacing it with scrolling. I want to do
          that because it allows for more variety in how images move/function.
        </p>
        <p>
          My UX goals are that I want to somehow take the user on a journey of
          my travels and photography experience. I want to be able to show my
          progress as a photographer and show off cool locations I have been to.
          The reason for this is one day I want to be able to look back on this
          and experience the story for myself.
