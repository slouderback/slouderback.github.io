            <h3>Melbourne, Australia</h3>
            <p>
              This picture was taken in Melbourne, Australia in 2018 while I was
              visiting for a convention called VidCon. Specifically this was
              taken at a restaurant built underneath the bridge that goes across
              the river pictured.

            <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
            <p>
              Going back to Rome here is a picture of the old city. Now all that
              is left are bits of buildings like this but you can imagine how
              magnificent it looked when it was first built. Thats why I like
              this picture because you dont really know what its a picture of
              and its left up to the viewer to fill it in how they wish.

            <h3>Matamata, New Zealand</h3>
            <p>
              This picture was taken in New Zealand at the actual set of the
              Shire featured in The Hobbit. The set for the Shire in Lord Of The
              Rings was mostly done in movie sets and the rest was torn down
              however when they rebuit it for The Hobbit they decided to leave
              it. Now anyone can come and visit and walk around the actual
              Shire. You can even get a beer at The Green Dragon!

            <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>
            <p>
              This is a picture of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy taken at
              night. I personally really liked how the light reflected off of
              the water. I also thought it was interesting because of the light
              gradiant that forms as you look up from the bottom. There is very
              little overhead light here which was unlike a lot of other
              locations I visited during that trip.
