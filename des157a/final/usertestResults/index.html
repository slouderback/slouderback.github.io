        <p id="mainText">User Test Results</p>

      <main>
        <div>
          <p>
            Something found was that it isnt obvious you need to scroll down to
            continue going through the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing is that it isnt clear when you reach the bottom of the
            page that you're actually there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally I noticed that when it was unclear what to do the first
            thing they tried was clicking on the landing page text.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div>
          <p>
            To fix these I plan on putting a chevron at the bottom of the
            landing page and possibly applying a little bounce animation on it
            after 5 seconds if the user hasnt scrolled yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also want to add a background change for the footer so that people
            can visually see they have reached the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I want to make it so if you click the landing page text you
            scroll to the start of the main content.
          </p>
